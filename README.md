# Hello, Comprehend!

This is the code project for the [Hello, Comprehend!](https://davidpallmann.hashnode.dev/hello-comprehend) blog post. 

This episode: Amazon Comprehend. In this Hello, Cloud blog series, we're covering the basics of AWS cloud services for newcomers who are .NET developers. If you love C# but are new to AWS, or to this particular service, this should give you a jumpstart.

In this post we'll introduce Amazon Comprehend and use it in a "Hello, Cloud" .NET program to perform Natural Language Processing. We'll do this step-by-step, making no assumptions other than familiarity with C# and Visual Studio. We're using Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.

## Our Hello, Comprehend Project

After getting familiar with Amazon Comprehend in the AWS Console, you'll write a .NET 6 program that invokes Comprehend to analyze text to 1) analyze sentiment, 2) detect entities, and 3) detect PII and redact the personal information from the text.

See the blog post for the tutorial to create this project and run it on AWS.
