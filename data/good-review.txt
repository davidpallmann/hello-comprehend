I've been a professional software developer for decades, and I found this book to be a great overview of QA best practices from a developer's perspective. As developers, we are the only ones that can inject quality into software - everyone else can only point out a lack of quality. This book provides devs with not only the tools, but more importantly, the attitudes to build quality software.
